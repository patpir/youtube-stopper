pause-all-youtubes
==================

A simple Firefox extension to pause all Youtube videos currently playing.
Using just a single button you can pause multiple videos playing at the
same time (e.g. after a session restore). It also removes the necessity to
find the right tab to pause (e.g. when the phone is ringing).
This even works over multiple Firefox windows.

Installation
------------

To install the extension locally just run `make debug` (requires that you
have installed the
[Extension Auto-Installer](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/autoinstaller)
by Wladimir Palant and it's configured to use the default port 8888 on the
local machine), or go to `about:addons` and select
`Install Add-on From File...` from the menu next to the add-on search bar.

Future
------

The following features are currently on the wishlist:
 - a list of all open Youtube videos to select one to play/pause
 - a lock to prevent auto-play for newly opened Youtube videos
